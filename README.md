## **Description:**

This report was completed by myself, Kynnedy Smith, and Brian Luna as part of a project in a course on linear algebra and machine learning. Together, we used CitiBike station availability data to model the optimal times to find a bike at a CitiBike station near the campus of Columbia University.
